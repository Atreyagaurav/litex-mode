* LiTeX mode
   This is a minor mode to convert valid elisp/lisp expressions to latex.

   This is useful for emacs users because emacs allows lisp code to be directly evaluated inside any buffer, which means no need to have any code blocks. But since lisp expressions aren't popular we can't expect to put them in reports, so to overcome that I wrote this mode with the help of my friend [[https://gist.github.com/bpanthi977][Bibek Panthi]].

   The beginning of this mode, and previous codes are here:
- [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/70358/how-can-i-convert-a-lisp-expression-to-a-latex-math-expression/70360?noredirect=1#comment113158_70360][Stackexchange Question]]
- [[https://gist.github.com/bpanthi977/4b8ece0eeff3bc05bb82275a23cbb56d][Bibek's gist]]
- [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/emacs-modules][My previous calculation template mode and first few versions of LiTeX]]

For example if you look at this image you can see how just 1 lines of lisp expression can be converted to the final result of several lines of mathematical expression without even having to do any of the calculation.

[[./images/litex.png]]

Not only can it convert lisp expressions to latex, it can also, give intermediate solution steps. Perfect for doing homeworks (as that's what I made it for) :P

NOTE: elisp uses integer calculations so ~(/ 1 2)~ is evaluated to 0, be careful of such pitfalls. For now ~(/ 1.0 2)~ is evaluated as ~0.5~, so I'd recommend using floats when you need floats, and I'm working on optional integration with slime which doesn't have this problem.

* How to Use

  Here is a [[https://youtu.be/esEf63gSSPg][demo video]] describing the features of LiTeX mode.

  For Text descriptions refer sections below for details on what each function does, and the meaning of custom variables.

  You can also access it all from texinfo file provided with the package.

* Installation
  You can install it through melpa with ~M-x package-install litex-mode <ret>~.

  Or you can clone this github repo and load it using path.

  Configuration section shows how you can add the load path using ~use-package~.

* Usage
    Using ~use-package~ you can do:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package litex-mode
  ;; :load-path "/path/to/litex-mode/"
  :commands litex-mode
  :hook text-mode)
#+end_src

* Keybindings
  By default LiTeX-mode doesn't provide any keybindings, but it does have a variable containing bindings for the interactive functions that you can use.


** Setting keybindings for individual functions
   You can use ~local-set-key~ to bind individual functions to a key binding.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (local-set-key (kbd "×") 'litex-insert-or-replace-x)
#+end_src

** Setting the whole litex provided keybindings to a prefix key

   You can set a prefix key (~C-e~ for me here) like in this example, which makes it so you can for example use ~litex-format-region-last~ using ~C-e f~ using the following in your config. In some cases you might have to unset key ~C-e~ because it's used to goto end of line, I'm replacing that because I don't use it (as ~End~ key does the same).
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-e") litex-key-map)
   #+end_src


Contents of litex-key-map are below.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "F") 'litex-format-region)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "f") 'litex-format-region-last)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "E") 'litex-eval-and-replace)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "e") 'litex-eval-and-insert)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "s") 'litex-sexp-to-latex-exp)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "S") 'litex-sexp-solve-all-steps)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "+") 'litex-increment-number)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "l") 'litex-exp-to-latex)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "m") 'litex-exp-in-latex-math)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "A") 'litex-sexp-solve-all-steps-equation)
(define-key litex-key-map (kbd "a") 'litex-sexp-solve-all-steps-eqnarray)
  #+end_src


** Complete setup using use-package
   This is the complete setup using use-package, if you installed from melpa. If you installed by cloning the repo, uncomment and provide the load path.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package litex-mode
  ;; :load-path "/path/to/litex-mode/"
  :commands litex-mode
  :hook text-mode
  :config
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-e") litex-key-map)
  (local-set-key (kbd "×") 'litex-insert-or-replace-x))
  #+end_src

* Tips and Tricks

** Using Greek letters
   Someone who writes in LaTeX will definitely want to include greek letters, so you can use greek letters multiple ways in LiTeX.

*** By double escaping the backslash
    You can use double escape to escape the backslash so you'll get the variable correct. For example: ~(setq \\alpha 2)~ ⇒ ~\alpha = 2~

*** Using Unicode:
    You can input unicode greek letters like α,β,γ...,Σ...,Ω, and they'll be rendered fine by LaTeX. For example: ~(setq α 2)~ ⇒ ~α = 2~. Which is the default behavior.

    If you want to use them to input, but still want to use LaTeX equivalent command then you can set ~litex-make-unicode-to-latex~ to true, that'll convert the unicode to LaTeX command. For example: ~(setq α 2)~ ⇒ ~{\alpha} = 2~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq litex-make-unicode-to-latex t)
    #+end_src

    As for how to type unicode directly, you can use Compose key in Linux machines, and there is also TeX input method in emacs that lets you do that. If you type ~C-u C-\ TeX <RET>~ for TeX input method then when you type ~\alpha~ emacs will convert it into unicode ~α~.

*** Using conversion from their names
    By default you can use variables names like ~alpha~ without having it any effect, for example: ~(setq alpha 2)~ ⇒ ~alpha = 2~ but if you set the variable ~litex-make-name-to-latex-glyph~ true then you can just convert normal greek character's names to LaTeX symbols.
Like: ~(setq alpha 2)~ ⇒ ~{\alpha} = 2~

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq litex-make-name-to-latex-glyph t)
    #+end_src


* Explanation for functions

** litex-format-region-last
   Formats the selection based on variable ~litex-format-string~.

   For example: ~2.3434343~ ⇒ ~2.34~ (when ~litex-format-string~ is ~.2f~)

** litex-format-region
   Same as ~litex-format-region-last~ but asks for the format, it also sets the ~litex-format-string~ variable.

   *NOTE*: Doesn't work well with multiple-cursors, so first use this once, then use the ~litex-format-region-last~ on the multiple cursors.

** litex-eval-and-replace
   Evals the last sexp and replaces it with the evaluation value.

** litex-eval-and-insert
   Evals the last sexp and inserts the evaluation value after that.

   The value and sexp are separated by ~litex-steps-join-string~ which is "= " by default.

** litex-sexp-to-latex-exp
   Converts valid lisp sexp to latex Expression:

   For example: ~(+ 2 3 (* 6 x))~ ⇒ ~2 + 3 + 6 x~

** litex-sexp-solve-all-steps
   Solves lisp sexp steps by steps:

   For example:
   ~(setq x 5)~ ⇒ ~x = 5~ then ~(setq y (+ 2 3 (* 6 x)))~ ⇒ ~y = (+ 2 3 (* 6 x))  = (+ 2 3 (* 6 5))  = (+ 2 3 30)  = 35~

** litex-increment-number
   Increments the number.

   ~some/url/to/chapter-2~ ⇒  ~some/url/to/chapter-3~

** litex-exp-to-latex
   Converts exponential term to latex format.

   ~1.23e-34~ ⇒ ~1.23 \times 10^{-34}~


** litex-exp-in-latex-math
   Encloses the selection in latex inline math.

   ~1.23e-34~ ⇒ ~\(1.23e-34\)~

** litex-sexp-solve-all-steps-equation
   Same as ~litex-sexp-solve-all-steps~ but puts them in equation environment.

   For example: ~(setq y (+ 2 3 (* 6 x)))~ ⇒

   #+begin_example
\begin{equation}
y= 2 + 3 + 6 x  = 2 + 3 + 6 \times 5  = 2 + 3 + 30 = 35
\end{equation}
   #+end_example

** litex-sexp-solve-all-steps-eqnarray
   Same as ~litex-sexp-solve-all-steps~ but puts them in eqnarray* environment.


   For example: ~(setq y (+ 2 3 (* 6 x)))~ ⇒

   #+begin_example
\begin{eqnarray*}
y &=& 2 + 3 + 6 x \\
 &=& 2 + 3 + 6 \times 5 \\
 &=& 2 + 3 + 30\\
 &=& 35
\end{eqnarray*}
   #+end_example


* Customization

* Contributing
  Since this package is new, I'd appreciate contributions on few things:

  - Finding bugs and reporting them in github issues.
  - There are many tests to be written for the functions.
  - Many functions that might have special syntax in LaTeX yet to be written. For example ~1+~, ~defun~ were added later (it only started with 4 operators), similar could be done for many more.
  - Fixing some glitches with the current functions.
  - Maybe some symbolic calculations using ~calc-eval~ if it has variables that are not yet defined.
